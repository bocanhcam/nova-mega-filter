# Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```shell
composer require digital-creative/nova-mega-filter
```

## Basic Usage

Basic demo showing the power of this package:

```php
use DigitalCreative\MegaFilter\MegaFilter;
use DigitalCreative\MegaFilter\MegaFilterTrait;

class ExampleNovaResource extends Resource {

    use MegaFilterTrait;

    public function filters(RequestRequest $request): array
    {
        return [
            MegaFilter::make([
                DateOfBirthFilter::make(),
                UserTypeFilter::make(),
            ]),
        ];
    }

}
```

And you are done!

Previously this package also had the ability to toggle columns, but since the nova 4 upgrade this functionality has been
moved away to its own package: https://github.com/dcasia/column-toggler

---

You can also add other fields alongside your Mega Filters, they will be rendered as usual:

```php
use DigitalCreative\MegaFilter\MegaFilter;
use DigitalCreative\MegaFilter\MegaFilterTrait;

class ExampleNovaResource extends Resource {

    use MegaFilterTrait;

    public function filters(NovaRequest $request): array
    {
        return [
            MegaFilter::make([ ... ]),
            
            // These will be rendered as normal on the usual tiny filter dropdown
            DateOfBirthFilter::make(),
            UserTypeFilter::make(),
        ];
    }

}
```

You can also set how many columns you want to display your filters:

```php
public function filters(NovaRequest $request): array
{
    return [
        MegaFilter::make([ ... ])->columns(3),
    ];
}
```

By default, the filter section is collapsed. If you want it to open or expanded initially, you can do:

```php
public function filters(NovaRequest $request): array
{
    return [
        MegaFilter::make([ ... ])->open(),
    ];
}
```

> Note: At the moment this package only works with a single Mega Filter per resource, adding multiple on the same resource may result in unexpected behavior.
